We're happy to announce the release of PhoneGap Desktop 0.4.0, with support for PhoneGap templates! These templates help you build apps quickly with popular features like Push Notifications, Augmented Reality and frameworks like React and Framework7. We've also included and recommend our [_PhoneGap Star Track_] (http://phonegap.com/blog/2016/04/21/introducing-star-track-by-phonegap/) template for those who want to get started using a more complete app example.

## Additional Updates
In addition to the template support, we've also added some other updates worth noting:

- __Drag and Drop Workflow__: the drag and drop workflow updates in this release make it even easier to add your existing projects to PhoneGap Desktop. Simply drag a project with a valid `config.xml` into the project list workspace and automatically served for testing.

- __Default Icon Handling__: the default icon handling has changed to now display a CSS placeholder based on the app name when an icon has not already been configured for a project.

- __CLI Integration__: another update that isn't visually noticeable but still important, is the removal of our dependency on the `connect-phonegap` middleware. We are now using the PhoneGap CLI to do all of the project `create` and `serve` functions. This change marks a first step toward maintaining congruency between our Desktop and CLI users going forward. 

For more details on the above and all other updates and fixes, see the [0.4.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/milestone/39?closed=1).
