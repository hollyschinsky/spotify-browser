## What You Will Learn

- How to handle specific mobile challenges such as handling click delay, native alerts, check for offline and use a single page architecture.

- How to use several PhoneGap APIs via plugins


## Requirements

- To complete this workshop, all you need is a code editor, a modern browser, and a connection to the Internet.

- A working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed, but you don't need to be a JavaScript guru.

>A mobile device or a Mobile SDK is **not** a requirement for this tutorial. You will able to test your application in the browser or with the 
[PhoneGap Developer App](app.developer.com) with some limitations. If you want the full support of the native APIs then you will need the mobile 
SDK for that platform (iOS SDK, Android SDK, etc.) installed on your system.
